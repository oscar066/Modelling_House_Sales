## Methods

<p>fter exploring and preprocessing the data,linear regression models were built in OLS statsmodels, with price as the dependent variable.</p>

## Conclusions

<p><li>Together, square footage, grade and bathrooms are the best predictors of a house's price in King County. Homeowners who are interested in selling their homes at a higher price should focus on expanding square footage and improving the quality of construction. When expanding square footage, homeowners should consider building additional bathrooms, as this analysis suggests that number of bathrooms is positively related to price.

## Recommendations

<p><li>We recommend that Homeowners should consider sqft_living ,grade and bathrooms when planning on selling their houses
